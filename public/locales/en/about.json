  "DMP": "Daryl & Molly Porter",
  "p1": "Our pastor is Daryl Porter. He and his wife Molly are missionaries from Canada. The Porters have lived in Ukraine since 2000 and in Krivoy Rog since 2012. They have two adult children and five grand children. One of the main goals of them living in Ukraine is to establish new Evangelical free churches and help them to grow. Daryl is also the Area Director for all of the EFCCM (Evangelical Free Church of Canada Mission) missionaries serving in Europe. During the year (October-May) the Porters lead an English club at their place. In the summer they also organize and teach at a 3-week Summer English Institute.",

  "p2": "It needs to be mentioned that Daryl's main hobby is running. All of his life he has run marathons and half marathons. It helps him to discipline himself not only physically, but also spiritually. How? Because in a very real sense our spiritual life is a race: we are running, get tired, fall, want to quit but get up and keep running until we see the finish line. We keep our eyes on Jesus who ran the race before us. He never stopped even though the way was hard. So we too should keep going just like He did.",

  "DISTINCTIVES": "Distinctives of the Evangelical Free Church of Ukraine",
  "D1": "EFCU membership consists of those who have a personal faith in Jesus Christ",
  "D1P1": "As part of the great heritage of Evangelical Free Churches in the world is the fact that the possibility of Christian fellowship and ministry in the local church is based solely on the individual's personal faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord and trusting Him alone in relation to their salvation.",
  "D1P2": "For membership, a person needs to agree with sound doctrine, which is expressed in our creed. At the same time, people are not deprived of the opportunity to become a member of a local church, if he or she has a different point of view in the secondary doctrinal matters not mentioned in Creed. Inside the EFCU there is the possibility of robust differences in the understanding of certain aspects of the Christian faith.",
  "D2": "EFCU is not seeking isolation",
  "D2P1": "We have the firm conviction that the teachings and way of life of Christians should be based on the authority of God's Word. This is important for us that minor doctrinal issues did not become an obstacle for communication, firstly, within the local church. Secondly, we chose to be open to dialogue with a broad spectrum of Christians from other denominations that adhere to basic Bible doctrines.",
  "D2P2": "Regarding our way of life in the world, we believe in the need for personal holiness and that we should not live according to the world standards. However, we are not separatists, and,thirdly do not isolate ourselves from fellowship with those who do not believe and do not live as we do, but try to make our faith in Christ visible to them.",
  "D3": "EFCU adheres to the spriritual rather than the structural unity of the church",
  "D3P": "We believe in the spiritual unity of the universal Church, but we do not support the movement for the unification of the Church in a single structure. We can cooperate with other Christian denominations and parachurch organizations that have similar goals, beliefs, and ministry, but we believe that there is strength in diversity and that it is important to maintain our distinctive features. We are convinced that the structural unity does not guarantee the unity of the Spirit.",
  "D4": "EFCU believes in Christian freedom with responsibility",
  "D4P": "We believe in Christian freedom, but freedom always has its limitations. Responsible Christians do not abuse freedom. The apostle Paul wrote convincingly about Christian freedom in Galatians. He crushes the legalists with the doctrine of grace. But in the first and second Corinthians, as well as in Romans the Apostle also rebukes the believers for the abuse of freedom. He boldly proclaims the principles of Christian freedom, but at the same time, with equal urgency emphasizes the importance of Christian responsibility. The EFCU wants to save freedom in Christ for every believer. We encourage our members and attenders to be responsible and godly people who live under the control of the Holy Spirit, and in obedience to the principles and precepts of God's word.",
  "D5": "EFCU believes in the importance of both mind and heart of Christianity",
  "D5P": "We believe that Scripture must be accepted and applied in every Christian's life with an open mind and heart. That is, we are convinced that it is essential to have a solid biblical foundation in the doctrinal understanding of our faith, but it is equally important to have a dynamic, living fellowship with God through His Son Jesus Christ and to live by the power of the Holy Spirit. Christian doctrine must be firmly connected with dynamic Christian experience.",
  "D6": "EFCU is a congregational form of governance",
  "D6P1": "EFCU is committed to a congregational form of government. This means that every local church has the right to manage their own affairs. At the same time, the highest human authority in the local church is the collective will of the community. We believe that a strong pastoral leadership, coupled with mature, servant Christians, creates prerequisites for significant spiritual and numerical growth of the local church.",
  "D6P2": "While the EFCU asserts the right of every local church to manage their affairs, it also supports biblical values of interdependence and cooperation. We are a Church movement committed to working together to fulfill the Great Commission in Ukraine and abroad. This is only possible if there are strong links between local churches in the EFCU.",

  "WHO_WE_ARE_SUB": "We are an Evangelical Free Church and part of the Evangelical Free Church of Ukraine Association. Our roots come from the Evangelical Free Church of Canada.",

  "WHO_WE_ARE_SUB2": "To love the Lord God above all else",
